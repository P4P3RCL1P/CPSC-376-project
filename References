4.	https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/10492/how-to-get-element-number-in-a-list
Reference for getting us situated with using cl-lib and how to implement the cl-position in lists. This was not needed later on in our project development as this method only works with lists. As the main function of our algorithm depends on arrays, we later made use of the aref and aset methods.
5.	https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Array-Functions.html
Helpful for determining the scope of array methods available within the elisp language

Documentation for emacs lisp. Lifesaver in referencing what functions do and how to use them 
7.	https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/calc/Matrix-Tutorial.html
Helped establish the framework for our multidimensional list.
8.	http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/elisp_idioms_prompting_input.html

10.	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42603751/how-to-set-an-element-in-a-multi-dimensional-array-in-elisp
Additional help for determining the value of having multidimensional arrays, and gave us a better perspective of using 1d arrays/lists.

Very helpful guide towards understanding emacs lisp and it’s status in the programming world.
12.	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FppjUvUDO4o
Tutorial for emacs lisp
Gained understanding of the Emacs text editor application and gave us an idea of what environment we could switch from repl.
